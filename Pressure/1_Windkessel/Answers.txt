---2 - element Windkessel---
Pressures:
Systolic = 120 mmHg
Diastolic = 80 mmHg
Pulse = 40 mmHg (120-80)

---Aging process---
Set C1 to 2
New pressures:
Systolic = 115 mmHg
Diastolic = 85 mmHg
Pulse = 30 mmHg

---Other Windkessel Models---
Differences:
First is a 2-element Windkessel model, second is 3-element and third is a 4-element.

2-element:
Sin-like curve 
3-element:
Has a linear end to all pressure drops. Higher amplitude
4-element:
Similiar to 3-element but "bounces" before going linearly down. Similar amplitude to 2-element. Closer to reality.
