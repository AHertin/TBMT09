2)
The Aortic valve flow corresponds to ventricular outflow. (0.35s) - Diastole
Mitral valve flow is the ventricular inflow. (0.55s) - Systole

7) a)

EDV +- 10 ml with high/low preload. None with afterload
ESV +- 11 ml with high/low afterload. None with preload

Stroke Volume = EDV - ESV:
High afterload gives lower SV. Low gives higher SV
High preload gives higher SV. Low gives lower SV
