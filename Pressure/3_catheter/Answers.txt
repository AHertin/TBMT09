--- Catheter model ---
1) 
We can influence length (l) radius(r) and compliance(C).
For length we would rather have a slightly too long than too short.
For radius we want something that is not too big (external radius) and does not 
impede with measurments (internally)
For compliance we want as a value as low as possible.

4)
Catheter 2 and 3 has good looking frequency response plots. It is possible that the peak 
for catheter 2 will impact it negatively because it is too high. Therefore 3 is best.

5)
Catheter 1 is overdamped
Catheter 2 is underdamped
Catheter 3 is good, maybe slightly underdamped
Catheter 4 is decent, a bit more underdamped than catheter 3
